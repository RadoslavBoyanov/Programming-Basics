My projects in education in Software University, Sofia, Bulgaria. In the "Programming Basics" course, I acquired the programming skills necessary for all technology majors at the Software University. I started the training on the 5th of February and successfully completed it on the 27th of March.
Skills I have acquired:
 - working with the console (data input and output)
 - working with loops (for)
 - work with more complex logical checks
 - working with logical checks (if-else)
 - perform simple calculations
 - working with more complex loops (nested for loops and while)
